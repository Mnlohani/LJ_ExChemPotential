# LJLiquids_Excess_ChemPotential
A Python based computional package of calculating excess chemical potential for LJ liquids using Thermodynamic Integration 

## Requirement
Python, HALMD package, Numpy, Lua.

HALMD is a high-precision molecular dynamics package for large-scale simulations of the complex dynamics in inhomogeneous liquids.
