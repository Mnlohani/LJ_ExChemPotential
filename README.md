# LJLiquids_Excess_ChemPotential
A Python based computional package of calculating excess chemical potential for LJ liquids using Thermodynamic Integration

## Overview
Our method compares the result with analytical results from the paper[1] by J. Karl Johnson et. al. which shows a good proximity.
In addition, the method gives correct results for Hard-sphere liquids

## Requirement
Python, HALMD package, Numpy, Lua.

HALMD is a high-precision molecular dynamics package for large-scale simulations of the complex dynamics in inhomogeneous liquids.
